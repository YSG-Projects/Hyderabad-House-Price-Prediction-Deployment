# 🏠 House Price Predictor - Hyderabad

A machine learning web application that predicts the **house price in Hyderabad** based on various input features such as area type, number of bedrooms, location, size, and more.

The model is trained using real estate data and deployed using **Flask**, making it easy to interact with via a web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive web UI built with **HTML + Flask**
- Machine Learning model trained using **GridSearchCV**
- Trained model serialized using **joblib**
- Predict house prices in Hyderabad in real-time
- Ready for deployment on **Render**, **Railway**, or **Streamlit Cloud**

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection
- Train-test split
- Model tuning with **GridSearchCV**
- Final model saved as `house_price_model.pkl`
